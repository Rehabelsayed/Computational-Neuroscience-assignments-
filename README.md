# Neural Network Assignment

This project was started in March 2024 as part of a computational neuroscience course.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a simple feedforward neural network with:
- 2 inputs
- 2 hidden neurons
- 2 output neurons
- `tanh` activation function
- Random weights in the range [-0.5, 0.5]

## Timeline

- **March 2024**: Initial code uploaded with basic structure.
- **May 2024**: Code reviewed and improved after identifying logic errors.
